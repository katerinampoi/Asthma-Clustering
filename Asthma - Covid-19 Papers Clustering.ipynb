    "### Introduction\n",
    "The goal of this project is to explore research topics in asthma and coronviruses. What are the most popular topics the research community is focused on, before and after the COVID-19 outbreak? Are the areas of interest around asthma and coronaviruses the same before and after the appearance of SARS-CoV-2? \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python, to explore topics of research between asthma and coronaviruses before the identification of SARS-CoV-2, but also after the outbreak of the pandemic. The analysis is based on clustering scientific publications, in order to create groups of papers with similar topics. Two groups of clusters are created, one for papers published before and one for papers published after the COVID-19 outbreak. For the two periods of times, clustering aims at identifying popular research topics and finding potential gaps in research between asthma and the new coronavirus.\n",

    "From this large database, I keep only those papers where the word \"asthma\" appears at least once in the abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "I went through the following text preprocessing steps, using NLTK and SpaCy:\n",
    "- Removal of stop words\n",
    "- Removal of non-English publications\n",
    "\n",
    "Using their publication date, I divided the papers into those published before the outbreak of the pandemic (December 2019) and those published after. For the two groups of papers I applied:\n",
    "- Tokenization\n",
    "- Stemming\n",
    "- Use of the Scikit-learn's Tfidf Vectorizer to transform tokens into a matrix of TF-IDF features\n",
    "- Application of the KMeans algorithm for Clustering\n",
    "- Application of the PCA algorithm for dimensionality reduction and clusters' visualization\n",
