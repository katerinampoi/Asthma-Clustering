    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we explore the relationship between asthma and coronaviruses. What are the most popular topics the research community is focuses on, before and after the COVID-19 outbreak? Are the areas of interest around asthma and coronaviruses the same before and after the appearance of SARS-CoV-2? The relationship between respiratory disorders and SARS-CoV-2 infection and has been broadly studied in a molecular, clinical and epidiomiological level, but remains still a controversial subject. More details about this relationship can be found here:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we cluster scientific publications in the topic of asthma and coronaviruses.Clustering is performed using NLP techniques and is based in the most frequent words apppering in the papers. Two groups of clusters are created, one for papers published before and one for papers published after the COVID-19 outbreak. For the two periods of times, clustering aims at identifying popular research topics and finding potential gaps in research between asthma and the new coronavirus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic a large database, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), was created and has been made publicly available. CORD-19 is a resource of hundreds of thousands scholarly articles, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses.\n",

    "### Data processing\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we select only those papers where the word \"asthma\" appears at least once in their abstract. This data is found in \"asthma_data\" csv file. In this analysis, we only consider papers written in English language. We take December 2019 as the point where papers about SARS-CoV-2 started to be published. According to this date, we divide our data as \"Before COVID-19\" and \"After COVID-19\" entries.The following analysis is then the same for these 2 groups of papers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Python's NLTK we perfom tokenization and then stemming of the papers' abstract text. With Scikit-learn’s Tfidf Vectorizer, tokens are transformed into to a matrix of TF-IDF features. These TF-IDF features are then catogorized into clusters with the use of Kmeans algorithm. Finally, the PCA algorithm is used for dimensionality reduction and vizualisation of clustering in a 2-dimensional space."
